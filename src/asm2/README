Build Instructions
==================

To build the "uasm" assembler please make sure you have the following tools
installed:

* GCC C-Compiler
* GNOME GLib in some recent version
* GNU make
* pkg-config (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config)

These requirements are very common and most probably they are present on your
system.

Just type "make" in your shell to compile the assembler!

PS: If you prefer clang over GCC change line 1 of Makefile to "CC = clang"

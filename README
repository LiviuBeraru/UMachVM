The purpose of this project is to create a simple virtual machine called UMach.
The project consists of the following components:
1 - The virtual machine specification and usage instructions (doc folder).
2 - The implementation of the virtual machine in C. The implementation will 
    have two parts: 
    * the assembler, which generates machine code for the UMach VM and
    * the machine itself, which executes the machine code.
3 - Sample assembler Code demonstrating the machine instruction set.

This is a university project.
The specification language is German.
